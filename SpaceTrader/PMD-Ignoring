PMD's complaints are either fixed, on this list, or have not yet been looked at. Have Fun.

Things I can't figure out:
UseStringBufferForStringAppends - line 75 of CargoBay and line 196 of Marketplace
GodClass - Ship and MarketSellController
NPathComplexity - MarketBuyController and MarketSellController - it is saying the handleBuyMarketAction() is
		too complicated and should have less if statements



Violations to be Ignored And Why:
1 - ShortClassName for Ship.java - This is the simplest thing to call the class 
		that deals with the Player's ship and a longer name would be unnecessary.
17 - VariableNamingConventions in Universe.java - These are all Proper Names of 
		our Planets and SolarSystems and are capitalized everywhere
6 - SuspiciousConstantFieldName in Universe.java - These are, again, Proper Names
		of Planets and SolarSystems and are capitalized everywhere
5 - TooManyMethods - These classes are split by which screen they are controlling
		or by their specific task. To break them any further would be fragmenting
		their usefullness
5 - AvoidLiteralsInIfCondition - these are obvious literals that do not need to be
		replaced with defining variables such as you must have fuel to travel
6 - MissingBreakInSwitch - These fall through on purpose and it was more efficient
		to do so
