PMD's complaints are either fixed, on this list, or have not yet been looked at. Have Fun.

Things I can't figure out:
UseStringBufferForStringAppends - line 75 of CargoBay and line 196 of Marketplace
GodClass - Ship and MarketSellController
NPathComplexity - MarketBuyController and MarketSellController - it is saying the 
		handleBuyMarketAction() is too complicated and should have less if statements
UseUtilityClass - SoundController
UnusedModifier - Event



Violations to be Ignored And Why:
AddEmptyString - this is to ensure that the integers and other variables will be
		represented properly in the UI
AtLeastOneConstructor - most of these are screen controllers that use their
		initialize() instead of a constructor
AvoidLiteralsInIfCondition - these are obvious literals that do not need to be
		replaced with defining variables such as you must have fuel to travel
AvoidPrintStackTrace - This is only used in exception handling when all else fails
		The game, at this point, is going to crash anyway.
CommentSize - the javaDocs are whatever length they need to be in order to get the
		point across
MethodArgumentCouldBeFinal & LocalArgumentCouldBeFinal - it is a controversial rule, 
		and there is no particular reason for us to implement it here
MissingBreakInSwitch - These fall through on purpose and it was more efficient
		to do so
SignatureDeclareThrowsException - The vague Exception being thrown will be a problem
		with JavaFX and not handled anyway. This is found in Controllers dealing
		with Button clicks.
ShortClassName for Ship.java - This is the simplest thing to call the class 
		that deals with the Player's ship and a longer name would be unnecessary.
SuspiciousConstantFieldName in Universe.java - These are, again, Proper Names
		of Planets and SolarSystems and are capitalized everywhere
TooManyMethods - These classes are split by which screen they are controlling
		or by their specific task. To break them any further would be fragmenting
		their usefullness
UnusedPrivateMethod - These are mostly initialize() or other methods used by FX
VariableNamingConventions in Universe.java - These are all Proper Names of 
		our Planets and SolarSystems and are capitalized everywhere
